Quick Start
-----------

1. Install Dependencies: `node install`

2. Edit `/server.config.json` with the proper Hedgeable API username, private key, server uri & port to run the app.
File format:
```json
{
    "username": "<Hedgeable username>",
    "key": "<Hedgeable privateKey>",
    "server": "https://sandbox.hedgeable.com/api",
    "port": 3000
}
```

3. Build and start app: `npm start`.

    Optionally, also use `npm run webpack` to watch/build `/client` side code.


4. Go to `http://localhost:<config port>` on your browser.
